## My process

This project was built with the idea of putting into practice what I learnt from the book on SMACSS' methodology, applied through SASS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- SMACSS methodology

### What I learned

I learnt more on how to make certain choices regarding the separation of concerns between CSS classes and modules, as well as having a better insight on SASS' features.

### Continued development

The various parts of this component are still dependant too much on their siblings and children, so in the future I plan on focusing more on keeping the specificity as well as the depth of my selectors low.

### Useful resources

- [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) - Free ebook on a methodology that still works to this day, even if it was written 10 years ago.
